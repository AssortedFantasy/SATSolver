How should the project interact with the user?
Perhaps the most important question of them all!

Current Idea:
Its a command line application, using command line arguments to define usage

1. USER writes to INPUT.TXT 
2. USER communicates commands to MAIN
3. GETOPT is used to interpret User Commands
4. MAIN calls SATIO, passing in arguments from GETOPT
5. SATIO Calls the Lexer
6. The LEXER reads in from INPUT.TXT
7. The LEXER outputs tokens to the Parser
8. The PARSER converts the tokens to EXPRESSIONS
9. The PARSER returns the EXPRESSION to SATIO
10. SATIO calls the appropriate SATFORM function based upon GETOPT arguments, passing in the EXPRESSION
11. SATFORM calls MATHCORE functions and passes in the EXPRESSION
12. MATHCORE does the appropriate reductions on the EXPRESSION and returns it to SATFORM
13. SATFORM returns the expression to SATIO
14. SATIO appends the expression to OUTPUT.TXT
15. The USER reads result from OUTPUT.TXT
